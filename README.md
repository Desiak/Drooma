Drooma is a looping drumming app. 

You can play around with it and create your own beats, fills and grooves :D

Drooma is a combination of my two biggest passions recently- drumming and programming! <3

My goal was to create drumming app that looks good and works smoothly on most devices. 
Performance at this moment is pretty decent but there is still some work to be done in this matter,
and some updates are probably about to come in nearest future.

In this project is used: React (hooks), Sass, Web Audio API, MobX
